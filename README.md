## The available Optimization Methods in the website

### First-Order (Gradient) Methods
*Uses only the first derivative of the function to find new optimal point.*
- [Steepest Descent (1D/2D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/1_steepest.html)
- [Conjugate Gradient (1D/2D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/2_conjugate.html)

### Second-Order (Hessian) Methods
*Uses the first and second derivatives of the function to find new optimal point.*
- [Newton method (1D/2D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/3_newton.html)
- [Levenberg-Marquardt Method (1D/2D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/4_lmm.html)

### Zeroth-Order (derivative-free) Methods
*Doesn't use the derivatives of the function. Evaluates the function at various points to find the minimum.*

- [Golden cut (1D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/5_golden.html)
- [Powell (2D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/6_powell.html)
- [Nelder-Mead (2D)](https://bhagath555.github.io/OptiViz/html/7_nelder.html)
