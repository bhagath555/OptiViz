## The available Optimization Methods in the website

### First-Order (Gradient) Methods
*Uses only the first derivative of the function to find new optimal point.*
- Steepest Descent (1D/2D)  
- Conjugate Gradient (1D/2D)

### Second-Order (Hessian) Methods
*Uses the first and second derivatives of the function to find new optimal point.*
- Newton method (1D/2D)  
- Levenberg-Marquardt Method (1D/2D)

### Zeroth-Order (derivative-free) Methods
*Doesn't use the derivatives of the function. Evaluates the function at various points to find the minimum.*

- Golden cut (1D)  
- Powell (2D)  
- Nelder-Mead (2D)
